            <h2>Study choice</h2>
            <p>Ever since I was a kid I was always interested in mind games, number combinations and puzzles. The logic
                behind
                always intrigued me and could keep me busy for hours. But still I had a dream of becoming a doctor,
                because I wanted to help people
                but as time past I realized that I was not really interested in medicine but only in the idea of helping
                others.
                So I spent a lot of time looking for a way to that, that is when I was met with the ICT field. It was
                the perfect
                opportunity for me to do something for the rest of my life that was combination of my passion and will
                to help.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love the logic, the challenge, the opportunity to witness how an idea could become reality and its
                effects.
                To always have the opportunity to outdo the previous version and break the border of what possible and
                what is not.
                Experiment with any ideas and visions while still being valuable to our society.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my opinion, the ICT field is a very tough and challenging, and should not be underestimated. So
                succeeding in this field would make me extremely proud of myself and would give me the sense of
                self-accomplishment that I was able to conquer my dreams.
