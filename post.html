                <b>Study choice</b>
                <p>Ever since I was a kid I was alway interested in mind games, number combinations and puzzles. The logic behind
                   always intrigued me and could keep me busy for hours. But still I had a dream of becoming a doctor, because I wanted to help people
                   but as time past I realized that I was not really interested in medicine but only in the idea of helping others.
                   So I spent a lot of time looking for a way to that, that is when I was met with the ICT field. It was the perfect
                   opportunity for me to do something for the rest of my life that was combination of my passion and will to help.
                </p>
                <p>
                   I love the logic, the challenge, the opportunity to witness how an idea could become reality and its effects.
                   To always have the opportunity to outdo the previous version and break the border of what possible and what is not.
                   Experiment with any ideas and visions while still being valuable to our society.

                <b>Programming experience</b>
                <p>In my last school I took IT classes and was met with the basic of multiple coding languages, such as
                    MySQL, Python and C++. The rest of my classes were focused on C# which allowed me to dive deep into its structure.
                    It helped me improve my problem solving skills and critical thinking. Through it I was able to understand the basic logic behing programming.

                <b>ICT field of work</b>
                <p>Before making any final decision about the job a want there are numerous questions I need to ask myself. Do I want to work alone or in team?
                   Do I want to work on multiple small projects at once or focus all my energy on a big one? Would I rather work from home or in a big company? 
                   Although I do not know the answers to all these questions yet, I am sure I am looking for something that would allow me to work with other people.
                   And would give me the opportunity to support my lifestyle and have time for myself.
