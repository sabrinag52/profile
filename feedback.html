            <h2>Feedback</h2>
            <p>
                After showing my website to my classmates, student assistants and my teachers, I received numerous
                feedbacks. Most were positive, complimenting my work and pointing out what they liked and what impressed
                them. Of course, some of it was constructive criticism.
            </p>
            <p>
                My classmates advised me to pay more attention to the design of my website and ask myself if it actually
                represents my personality, since it is my portfolio it needs to represent me and my interests. As a
                result,
                I ended up changing most of it. I paid special attention to the colour pallet.
            </p>
            <p>
                The student assistants suggested that I note my code structure and if it was readable. That lead to me
                reviewing most of my code and creating mutable CSS files for the separate pages.
                My teachers guided me to pay more attention of the readability of my website and how would users
                perceive
                it. As a result, I stopped centring text in paragraphs.
