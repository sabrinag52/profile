            <p>
                Before making any final decision about the job a want, there are numerous questions I need to ask
                myself.Do I want to work alone or in a team?Do I want to work on multiple small projects at once, or
                focus all my energy on a big
                one? Would I rather work from home or in a big company? Although I do not know the answers to all these
                questions yet, mainly because there are
                numerous things that may change by the time I need to start working.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, there are a couple of
                things I want to be part of my working experience with certain. I am looking for something that would
                allow me to work with other people. I want a place where I would be able to express myself but also
                challenge me. And would give me the opportunity to support my lifestyle but still have time for myself.
                I am aware that my first workplace, maybe even my second one, may not be able to meet all my
                requirements but am detriment to keep looking for it and improve my programming skills and personal
                skills in the process.
