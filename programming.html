            <h2>Programming experience</h2>
            <p>In my last school, I took IT classes and was introduced to the basics of multiple coding languages, such
                as MySQL, Python and C++. The rest of my classes were focused on C#, which allowed me to dive deep into
                its structure. It helped me improve my problem-solving skills and critical thinking. Through it, I was
                able to understand the basic logic behind programming.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of my programming experience I have gained in the last month while building my website using HTML.
                This was my first time using it, and I had some difficulties, especially when it came to choosing the
                right tag and function to use. It took me some time to learn the right way to build the correct code
                skeleton. When it came to the design, I still met some problems that mainly consisted of me trying to
                position the items, more specifically the images, in the exact spot I wanted them.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was able to overcome all these problems with the help of my teachers, my study group and my own
                research. I had an amazing time exploring HTML and CSS and all their functions. Furthermore, I liked
                expressing my thoughts and giving life to my ideas. I like the idea that I am in control of the entire
                process and its maintainess. This project gave me the opportunity to summarize who I am as an individual
                and even challenged me with new ideas that I had not thought of before.
